                                     of milk. Commonly thought, the name derives from “American Coffee” during World War II when Americans added water to their espresso to create a larger 
                                     coffee that they were accustomed to back home. 
                                    Simply boil water (around 200ml or 6 oz), let it rest for a minute (don’t use the water while it’s boiling) and pour in a cup or mug. Then prepare 1 shot of 
                                    espresso (75ml / 2 oz or more if you like it stronger) and pour on top of the hot water.  </p>
